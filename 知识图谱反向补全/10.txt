Calcarenite beds, up to 1 m thick, occur near the top of the logged succession.
The limestones are overlain by a thin unit of lithic sandstone interbedded with greenish shale and conglomerate, directly beneath the Lycian Melang Clasts within this conglomerate comprise dolerite (20), red chert (4), basalt (10), lithic sandstone (25), chert limestone (15) and serpentinite (5).
There was a fundamental switch to clastic deposition in the Cenomanian±Turonian (as seen at Koycegiz), followed by up to 500 m of lithic sandstone turbidites, debris-flow deposits and mudstones of Campanian± Maastrichtian ag Clasts are similar to many of the lithologies within the overlying Lycian Melange, including serpentinite, gabbro, basalt, red chert and pelagic limeston Although poorly dated this transition is also visible at Eskihisar.
Limestones are mainly recrystallized, but decimetre- to metre-scale bedding is visible in places, with varying amounts of secondary chert.
See ure 1 for location A similar succession is found at Honaz Dagi (Okay 1989) where Upper Cretaceous calciturbidities (Bozkaya Limestone of Okay 1989) pass gradationally into purple Lower Eocene limestones rich in planktonic foraminifera (including Morozovella aequa, Globigerinidae and Acarinina bulbrooki; Collins 1997).
