Clasts are largely shelf-derived grey micritic limestone with rare chert and pink pelagic limestone derived from the Late Cretaceous ophiolite melang The megabreccia is interpreted as a rock-fall or debris-flow deposit  Simo 2002); such deposits are commonly related to oversteeping amakhalif 2001;Simo 2002) and are considered to reflect faulting of the margin of the Ulukissla Basin.
The breccias contain angular to sub-rounded clasts of basic to intermediate-composition volcanic rock in a silt- to sand-sized volcanogenic matrix, often hyaloclasti These beds are interpreted as debris-flow deposits indicative of the upper flanks of a Turbidites - Dominant grain size given Limestone Mud Sandstone Gravelstone Lava breccia Conglomerate / Breccia Pillow Lavas Ripple Lamination Burrows Cross-Bedding Planar Lamination Nummulites Bivalves Gastropods Zoophycos Flute casts.

Shallow-water carbonate build-ups (Basmakci Member) The first shallow-water carbonate facies (Basmakcsi Limestone of 1984) crops out south of Basmakcsi village as several folded and thrust outcrops (.
