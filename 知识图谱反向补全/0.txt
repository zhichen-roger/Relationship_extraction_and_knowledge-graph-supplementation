Dolomite samples from the fringing-reef complex and TCC have NRM values ( X 10'10 to  X 10'6 Am2/kg) generally somewhat higher but bracketing the range of Late Neogene shallowmarine carbonates of the Bahamas ( X 10â€œ9 to  X 10'7 Am2/kg [22]) and of the South Pacific (63 = 10'9 Am2/kg and 34 = 10'8 [23]).
