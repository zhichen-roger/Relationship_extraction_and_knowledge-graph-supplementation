Grainstone (intrabiopelsparites) are minor in occurrenc Facies associations include: fossiliferous limestone/dolostone and microbial laminites documenting a low-energy, restricted shallow subtidal environment to intertidal/supratidal settings in a ramplike depositional system comparable with the Balearic ramp-like platforms; temporary high-energy conditions also periodically instead of occured; dolomites/dedolomites after preexistent evaporites assigned to supratidal conditions and intermittent subaerial exposure as well as pedogenic limestone-conglomerates support a long-term, terrestrial exposure environment.
Grainstones (pelsparites-intrapelsparites) with ellipsoidal to round peloids-nodules are locally common (Pl.
